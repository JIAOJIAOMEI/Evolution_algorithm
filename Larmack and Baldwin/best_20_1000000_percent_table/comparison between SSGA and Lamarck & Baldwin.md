The performance of lamarck is similar to that of SSGA, and the performance of Baldwin is slightly inferior to that of SSGA.

In SSGA, each individual genotype and phenotype are the same, so in the whole group, whether it is based on genotype or phenotype to generate new individuals, new individuals are generated based on the best one in the whole group.

However, in Baldwin, the genotype and phenotype of each individual are different, Baldwin selected the best individual based on the phenotype, and then produced offspring based on the genotype of this best individual. The point is,  the genotype of the best individual selected according to the phenotype may not be the best genotype among all individuals.  In this case, the individual used to produce the offspring in each iteration of baldwin may not be the best in the whole group. Therefore, the performance of baldwin is a little bit worse than SSGA.

In Lamarck, although the genotype and phenotype are different, Lamarck selects the best individual according to the phenotype, and then produces offspring according to the phenotype of this best individual, so the performance of Lamarck and SSGA should be more or less the same.
