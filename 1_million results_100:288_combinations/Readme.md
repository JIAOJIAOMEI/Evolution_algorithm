**six functions**: f1 f3 f6 f12 f18 f22

**Dimensions**: 50 dimensinal functions are downgraded to 10

**Combiantions**: only the first 100 are generated. See "combinations_result_baseline.txt"

Sequence for iterations : [1000000]

Optimal solution :

```
opt = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -418.98 * 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.00030, -1.0316, 0.398, 3, -3.86, -3.32, -10.1532, -10.4028, -10.5363]
```

**Percentage_table**:

for this baseline function, there are 6 combinations of different mutation_types and crossover_types:

1. "Linear_combination_crossover_normal" 
2. "Linear_combination_crossover_uniform"
3. "Probabilistic_crossover_normal"
4. "Probabilistic_crossover_uniform"
5. "singe_point_crossover_normal"
6. "singe_point_crossover_uniform"

**for each function and each parameter combination, "data_analysis.pdf" compares the performances of different types.**

**for each function and each parameter combination, "percentage.pdf" compares the num of optimal values of different types.**

- True means it finds the optimal solution
- False means not.

each parameter combiantion, **10** runs.

==there maybe some errors with function 12, because some values appear to be smaller than zero which is supposed to be to optimal.I will chekc it again and find the reason.and for function 18, as i remember, two solutions are lower than the optimal, I don't understand.The rest combinations are still running.==
