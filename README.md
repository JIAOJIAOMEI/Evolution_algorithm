This is the code for [Comparing Lamarckian and Baldwinian Approaches in Memetic Optimization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-41774-0_41), I haven't cleaned the code yet.
The last run is here [thesis-last run](https://github.com/JIAOJIAOMEI/Evolution_algorithm/tree/main/thesis-last%20run), all the results and code for the paper is included.
